# Numerical Methods
## Program Objective:
It is Used to compare and analyze the behavior of numerical
methods {Bisection, False-position, Fixed point, Newton-Raphson,
Secant}.

## Program Description:
The program  takes as an input the equation, the technique to use and its required parameters.

## Program Specification:
### The program contains the following features:
- An interactive GUI that enables the user to enter equations containing different
functions such as: {poly, exp, cos, sin}. Reading from files must be available as
well.
- Differentiation and Parsing.
- A way to choose a method to solve the given equation.
- A way to enter the precision and the max number of iterations otherwise default
values are used.
- The answer for the chosen method indicates the number of iterations, execution
time, all iterations, approximate root, and precision.
- Compute the theoretical bound of the error for the methods.

## GUI:
#### Tools to build the GUI:
  - Qt designer
